start method:
=> used to start the execution of the thread.
=> perform following applications:
    register the thread with thread schedular.
    perform stack mechanism for the new threads.
    invoke run method.

join method:
    keep waittig the main method untill the thread processes complete.
    It is used to wait for a thread to finish its excution .

synchronisation:
    synchronisation is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads.
    This important to prevent data corruption and ensure consistency when multiple threads are concurrently accessing and modifying shared data.
    synchronized is key word to implement synchronisation.
    synchronisation is implemented in two ways:
    when a method is declared as synchronized only one thread can excute that method on the same instance of the class at a time.

synchronized block:
    It provide more fine grain control over synchronisation compare to synchronized method.
    It allows multiple thread to excute non synchronized code concurrently while ensuring that access to critical section is serailized.
