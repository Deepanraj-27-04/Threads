start method:
=> used to start the execution of the thread.
=> perform following applications:
    register the thread with thread schedular.
    perform stack mechanism for the new threads.
    invoke run method.

join method:
    keep waittig the main method untill the thread processes complete.
    It is used to wait for a thread to finish its excution .

synchronisation:
    synchronisation is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads.
    This important to prevent data corruption and ensure consistency when multiple threads are concurrently accessing and modifying shared data.
    synchronized is key word to implement synchronisation.
    synchronisation is implemented in two ways:
    when a method is declared as synchronized only one thread can excute that method on the same instance of the class at a time.

synchronized block:
    It provide more fine grain control over synchronisation compare to synchronized method.
    It allows multiple thread to excute non synchronized code concurrently while ensuring that access to critical section is serailized.


write a java program to check wheather the given number is vaild based on the following:
    1.number must be btwn 13 to 16 digits.
    2.number should start with either 4 or 5 or 6.
     step-2double every 2nd digits from right to left,if doubling of a digit results in a two digit number add the two digit to get a single number
     and now add all single digits numbers.
     step-3 add all digits in the odd places from right to left. 
     step-4 sum the result step 2 and step 3.
     step5- if the result from step is divisible by 10 then the number is valid othervise invalid.
